# Joel on Software - Developer's Side Projects

[Read the article here.](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2016/12/09/developers-side-projects/)

## My thoughts

In this article, Joel discusses the legality around side projects built by software developers. I had always assumed that any side project a software developer builds on their own time is their own intellectual property, so I was surprised to discover this is not the case. Joel explains the reasoning behind why companies will list ownership of all of your software as a requirement for accepting a job, and the logic certainly makes sense - they don't want to be sued when an employee claims they worked on some work-related project in their free time and deserve ownership of that project.

That said, it was quite frustrating to learn this, as I personally would like to work on my own side projects when I enter the workforce. Joel ellaborates that company views on side-projects can vary, but even working in a company that is welcoming to side projects can be concering. What if the company has a change in management years down the line, and claims ownership of one of your side projects that took off? I'll be sure to look more into New York's laws specifcally regarding side projects for developers.
